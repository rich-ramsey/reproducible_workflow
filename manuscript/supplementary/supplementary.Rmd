# Supplementary Materials #

## Model formulas ##

The regression formula for the full model (model b2):
$$rt \sim 1 + stimulus * compatibility + \\
(1 + stimulus * compatibility | pid)$$

*Note:* rt = reaction time (ms); stimulus = blah; compatibility = blah; pid = subject/participant identifier.


## A supplementary table ##

Here, I just reproduce the table from the main manuscript to save time making anything else.
But of course in a real paper, you wouldn't do this, you'd just show whatever you needed.
It is labelled differentlyto reflect that it is a supplementary table.

(ref:supp-table-caption) Fixed effects from model b2.

(ref:supp-note-caption) Median point estimates and 95% quantile intervals shown.

```{r fixed-table}
fix_tab <- read_csv("../../exp1/tables/b2_fix_tab.csv")

apa_table(
  fix_tab,
  caption = "(ref:supp-table-caption)",
  note = "(ref:supp-note-caption)",
  placement = "H"
)
```

## A supplementary figure ##

Let's take a look at the mixing of chains in the model.
This is a useful model diagnostic check to see that the model built ok.

(ref:supp-figure-caption) Caterpillar plots showing the mixing of chains across parameters in model b2.

```{r supp-figure-plot, fig.cap = "(ref:supp-figure-caption)"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../exp1/figures/b2_chains.jpeg")
```
